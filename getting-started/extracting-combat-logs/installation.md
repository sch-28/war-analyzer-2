# Installation

### Prerequisites

You will need to download and install [Npcap](https://npcap.com/#download). It is used to **sniff** the game's packages.\
\
Alternatively, you can download [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) to record your traffic and use the **Combat Logger** to analyze the recording. This also eliminates the risk of using an [**outdated config file.**](../../general/known-issues.md#problem)****

### Installing the Combat Logger

To use the Combat Logger, you can either use the pre-compiled executable or clone the repository and build it yourself.

#### 1. Bundled executable

Download the latest executable from [Combat-Logger Releases](https://github.com/sch-28/combat\_logger/releases) and grab the [current config](../../general/known-issues.md#config-file).

#### 2. Building from source

```batch
git clone https://github.com/sch-28/combat_logger
cd combat_logger
install
```
