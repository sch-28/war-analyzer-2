# Extracting Combat Logs

The combat logs are required to follow this format:

```
[xx:xx:xx] player_one died to player_two from guild
[xx:xx:xx] player_three has killed player_one from guild
```

Instead of manually copying your chat, you can use this tool:

{% embed url="https://github.com/sch-28/combat_logger" %}

{% content-ref url="installation.md" %}
[installation.md](installation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="usage.md" %}
[usage.md](usage.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
