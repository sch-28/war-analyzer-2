# Usage

Start the executable while the game is running. When combat messages are received, the program will write them to `<date>.log` (if the output name is otherwise not specified).

If you do not want to [risk losing data](../../general/known-issues.md#outdated-config-file), you can also run **Wireshark** to record the BDO network as a backup. Running the executable with the --file argument allows you to parse a recorded `*.pcap` file.
